# *Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models*

## *Project Overview*

Bek is a data scientist and programmer for the non-profit foundation, AlphhabetSoup. AlphhabetSoup help organizations that protect the environment and people's well-being and unify the world.

The foundation has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars in the past 20 years, this money has been used to invest in life saving technologies and organize reforestation groups around the world.

Bek is incharge for data collection and analysis for the entire company. Her job is to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This helps ensure that the foundation's money is being used effectively. Unfortunately not every donation that company makes is impactful.

The president of AlphhabetSoup Andy has asked Bek to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. He wants Bek to create a mathematical data driven solution that can do this accurately.

Bek has decided that this problem is too complicated for the statistical and machine learning models she has used earlier. Instead, she will design and train a deep learning neural network.
